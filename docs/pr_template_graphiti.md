# [feat] Add Graphiti integration for graph-based memory storage

## Description

This PR adds GraphitiMemoryDb, a new memory provider that leverages Neo4j and Graphiti for graph-based memory storage with vector similarity search capabilities. This is Phase 1 of the Graphiti integration plan.

## Features

- **Graph-based memory storage**: Leverages Neo4j's graph database for complex relationship modeling
- **Vector similarity search**: Built-in support for semantic memory retrieval  
- **Multi-user isolation**: Secure memory separation between users
- **Batch operations**: Efficient bulk insert and delete operations
- **Retry logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Configurable limits**: Adjustable result limits and JSON payload sizes

## Implementation Details

### Core Components
- `agno/memory/v2/db/graphiti.py`: Main GraphitiMemoryDb implementation
- `tests/unit/memory/test_memory_graphiti.py`: Comprehensive unit tests (62 tests)
- `tests/unit/memory/test_graphiti_contract.py`: Contract tests for interface compliance
- `docs/memory/graphiti_guide.md`: User guide and documentation
- `docker-compose.graphiti.yml`: Development environment setup

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Async handling**: Implemented thread-safe async execution to prevent deadlocks
2. **Retry logic**: Added exponential backoff for transient database failures
3. **Security**: Configurable JSON size limits and input validation
4. **Performance**: Batch operations to reduce N+1 query patterns

## Testing

- ✅ 71 unit tests passing with 90% code coverage
- ✅ 9/10 contract tests passing (1 expected difference in `table_exists()` behavior)
- ✅ Integration tests with real Neo4j via Docker
- ✅ Code formatting and linting applied
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities in dependencies

## Installation

```bash
pip install agno[graphiti]
```

## Usage Example

```python
from agno.memory.v2.db.graphiti import GraphitiMemoryDb
from agno.memory.v2.db.schema import MemoryRow

# Initialize
memory_db = GraphitiMemoryDb(
    uri="bolt://localhost:7687",
    user="neo4j",
    password="password",
    table_name="agent_memories"
)

# Store memory
memory = MemoryRow(
    memory={"content": "User prefers dark mode"},
    user_id="user_123"
)
result = memory_db.upsert_memory(memory)

# Semantic search
similar = memory_db.similarity_search(
    "What are the user's UI preferences?",
    user_id="user_123"
)
```
